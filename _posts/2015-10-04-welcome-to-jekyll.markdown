Thanks for checking out my blog!  This is where I plan to keep any thoughts
worth sharing - and maybe some code too.  Eventually some new content will
appear here once I get around to it.

See below for an example of code snippets.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Kevin'))
#=> prints 'Hi, Kevin' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
